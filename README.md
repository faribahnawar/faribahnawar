## About Me 
My name is Faribah, pronounced Fa-ree-bah. I'm a Canadian-born student attending SAIT and learning how to become a UX designer. I'm currently a first year in the first semester, learning all sorts of new ways to adapt UX and design practices/principles onto my own personal designs as well as projects. 

So far the journey has been pretty hectic but exciting. I have a lot of interest within this field and can't wait to learn more!

I would love to connect with fellow UX professionals and explore new opportunities. Feel free to reach out!

## My Interests

- Learning new and developing technologies
- Contributing my expertise to help people around me
- Taking pictures of different sceneries 
- Watching video essays on the down low to pass time
- Solving crosswords when I need a break
- Travelling to various countries, learning about different cultures and traditions

## Future Skills in the Making
1. Utilizing Figma
2. Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
3. Creating mockups & User flows
4. Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript in VSC
5. Managing code with Git and uploading on Github
