## About Me ☀️
My name is Faribah, pronounced Fa-ree-bah. I'm a Canadian-born student attending SAIT and learning how to become a UX designer. I'm currently a first year in the first semester, learning all sorts of new ways to intergrate UX and design practices/principles onto my own personal designs as well as projects. 

So far the journey has been pretty hectic but exciting. I have a lot of interest within this field and can't wait to learn more!

I would love to connect with fellow UX professionals and explore new opportunities. Feel free to reach out!

- Watching video essays on the down low to pass time
- Solving crosswords when I need a break
